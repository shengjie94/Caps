Hi! My name is Ari and I'm a senior at Yeshiva University.
In this session, we will look at a few strategies to help you study for your college courses.
The first thing to do is read through your course syllabi 
and glance through your textbooks or course readings.
Mark down exams and assignment dates on your calendar
and determine course expectations for each class.
Then, look through your readings and see how they're organized;
How long are the chapters? Are there practice problems or review questions?
Is there a chapter summary?
It is a good idea to read your text before class - that will help you stay focused
and better understand the lecture.
Also, try to get a sense of which courses require the most effort.
Your notes from your readings and class will later serve as a study guide to prepare you for exams.
Reviewing your notes after class will help you understand and remember the information.
Choose a place to study that has few distractions.
Many students prefer the library, others prefer a lounge or their dorm room.
Find what works best for you.
Our brains are not wires to take in new information
without an opportunity to consolidate or process the information.
Taking breaks will help you stay alert and improve your overall recall.
Do you sometimes feel a lack of focus or motivation when studying alone?
We all do. It's natural.
Many students find study groups to be beneficial.
Being part of a study group may actually help you remain motivated
and study more consistently.
The best way to ensure you understand the material is by teaching it to others.
Using these strategies, you'll be better prepared to tackle assignments and exams at Yeshiva University.
