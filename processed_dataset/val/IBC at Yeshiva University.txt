Coming out of yeshiva
I had done two years of classic shiur, seder, learning gemara.
I was looking for something a little different
and IBC gave me new options
and new learning opportunities that I didn't really have before.
IBC attracts the most diverse student population at YU.
You can study every topic imaginable.
If somebody wants to do more than just gemara,
they could do gemara, they could also do Tanach,
they could do Jewish philosophy, they could do halacha, they could do Jewish history,
chassidut, and neo-chassidut,
machshava, Jewish meditation,
Hebrew, Biblical Hebrew.
There's all types of classes for every type of student and you can mix and match
until you find the niche that you like.
There are many ways of connecting to Hakadosh Baruch Hu
and there's many types of Torah to connect to
and we want to afford that to our students.
There's a big variety of students
with various different diverse backgrounds in IBC
whether they have a lot of Jewish learning experience or not a lot.
The rabbis and professors in IBC are able to cater to everybody.
Anyone could take honors classes.
Those are typically smaller classes
with a greater focus on text and understanding than the general ones.
Even in the non-honors classes, students can find
challenging and enlightening and interesting classes
from extremely difficult Bible courses
and then a mussar course
which might be more on the lax side
but just as valuable in terms of what you're learning.
The flexibility of IBC is amazing.
You could take classes all morning,
you could take classes in the evening,
or you can even take classes online.
They also offer independent study, which is
if you have a topic that you're interested in learning
and it's not on the schedule,
if you find a rabbi and a few students that are interested in learning with you,
you can submit a form to the office and they will accept it
and you'll be taking that class with that rabbi.
College anywhere is a very difficult time
especially your first semester
and the FTOC Chabura created a format for guys
to continue to learn, to get their bearings
on what to expect in the yeshiva and the university.
It was nice, coming out of Israel,
to have a laid back kind of program
with a specific rabbi that I would have for the entire year.
It was a good chance to get to know
other guys in IBC and the rabbis.
I fell in love with Rabbi Chaim Angel's classes.
It was just amazing, it completely changed
how I ever learned tanach.
Rabbi Angel will be the mesader kiddushin at my wedding.
What I found from my IBC meetings
is just how concerned the IBC administration is
in terms of developing personal relationships with the students
and fostering their personal religious growth.
It's been an amazing thinking about the shabbatons that they plan,
trying to have more one on one lunch meetings with the students.
I know that many rebbeim
literally give their heart and soul for the IBC program.
We meet for lunch once every couple of months just to check in.
We've carved an hour everyday into the IBC schedule
to allow for students and rabbanim
to interact in a more personal way.
I think you get to meet a lot more people in IBC,
just through different classes.
Also the classes are much more interactive
and you get schmooze with everyone.
You literally meet everyone from the broad spectrum of yeshivas.
Students from Houston, there's students from Detroit,
students from Cleveland, New York, Venezuela,
France, some from Morocco. All over the globe.
When a person leaves IBC
they get a very lasting academic
and sophisticated perspective on Judaism.
I think IBC prepares you to be a learned Jew
who continues to learn by showing you the right ways
and different methods of learning.
It gives me knowledge that I wouldn't normally have.
Just good to have a more general understanding
of a big breadth of knowledge
rather than specialize in one area.
These students are not just interested in
opening up their notebooks, or now laptops,
and mimicking whatever the teacher is trying to say.
Their gears are turning, they're independent thinkers
and they're trying very hard to develop their knowledge base
but also their skill sets and their own critical thinking skills,
all within the context of their own personal religious growth.
It's inspiring.
It's a gem in the great crown of YU
and it's something that more and more students,
particularly top flight students, are availing themselves of
particularly top flight students, are availing themselves of
because this shapes their religious development
because this shapes their religious development
the way that they want to shape it.
