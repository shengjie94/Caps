Creativity, I think, is
the calling of humans beyond just existing.
If we're given that capacity, we should really flex
those muscles.
The art department is all about finding your
voice within your medium and what you want to do.
The Stern art department focuses on
foundational studies in drawing
and painting and design,
and then offers upper level electives in the
areas that our faculty are experts in.
Ultimately you could build your own program to any end.
If you want to go down to a basic assortment,
it's graphic design, interior design,
fine art making, sculpture, pre-architecture, and theater design
fashion design, film and video,
art therapy, photography,
and even animation, in some cases.
There's a wide range of ideas and
thoughts running within these walls.
When the elevator will go up to the eighth floor and I'll
be with students who don't know there's an art department, they'll be like, "Oh, what
floor is this?" And I'll be like, "Oh, it's the art department, you should check it out!"
The studio art department here at Stern
is a familial space.
It's a very open, friendly vibe.
That is so essential to becoming
better artists and helping each other.
When I've taught in other places, there's a tendency to
maybe get a little too competitive. I don't see that here.
The ethos of Yeshiva University certainly impacts
the art. There is a sense of warmth
and community and a lot of the work.
When a class of art majors is graduating,
I feel like I know each of those
students and their work
really well. I've seen how
they've developed as young artists from coming in
and taking those first beginning classes to
developing their senior projects.
I have a series of pieces in the upcoming senior show.
This is one of the pieces. It plays
with how changing the color and changing the typography changes
the meaning, because it's light pink and cotton candy
fonts. It's lighthearted. You wouldn't
really stop and care if you saw the sign. You wouldn't be scared to walk in.
It came from a lot of the freelance work I do, and my
clients not really knowing what design is,
and they don't really understand the design process.
So it takes into account how changing
the design changes the meaning.
My project "Too Muchness" is a mixture
of colorful whimsicalities, where
the person in the project
realizes that she can't be boxed into one
persona, Because we are multifaceted
people and through life, we change.
I used to believe that art had to be this technically
complicated thing. Something that would make people
feel uncomfortable. I kept gravitating towards
motifs of joy and calm
I realized that my voice within my artwork
is to make people feel happy.
There are so many people that will see it, and I won't know their stories,
and I won't know their backgrounds. But I know that they
will see my piece and take whatever they
want to take from it, and hopefully
feel a moment of resonance and joy.
