Care Cafe is a program that is actually a reimagining
of a program that started in Amsterdam that was called
repair cafe looking at people throwing away
toasters and blenders and things like that because they didn't know how to fix them.
Experts would be there who
knew how to fix these things and people could come
in and instead of throwing something away
they could get it fixed. In the doing of that
people really connected to each other and started
to have community experiences.
And as we talked about it more and more we decided that this
reimagining for Wurzweiler would be Care
Cafe where we try to heal the human heart.
The whole philosophy behind it that came from Dean Wozniak
which is amazing is that you want to help
people with challenging issues but also
from a very strength based perspective.
Care Cafe's about giving back to the community and
it's about instilling hope in people
and giving people a chance to get to events
and listen to speakers that they probably wouldn't have
otherwise. And I think it's an education experience.
Today's Care Cafe was called Beyond Meals Ready
to Eat and it was about creating nutrition
and wellness as part of an overall transition
program for veterans and give them the idea
that we want to talk about nutrition and food as something
that can be really delicious and really part of one's everyday life.
While they're out there doing the service for us
they're not eating as well. They're in dire need of our help
as well to implement nutritous
food for them to get their energy back.
They come here looking for a community
looking for networking. And when I see
them during the sessions I see them
gradually open themselves.
They smile at strangers.
They talk like old friends.
I know they find their networking.
That treat Care Cafe as their community.
It's so touching.
Care Cafe is completely free.
It's funded by a number of grants through New York
City and the services are offered by our students
and by our speakers at no cost to
the participants or to the venues.
The other part besides what they get when they come to the event,
the connection and the speaking, they get to go
home with this pack of resources. And that was a big part
of the idea behind this is that you're supporting
them not just when they come but you're supporting them out
and beyond in their life. And so in this packet
are all of these things about
meditation and yoga and art
things and career
sites and things that will help vets to come
to a new chapter in a healthy way. Also about nutrition how
to cook healthily for yourself, nourish yourself.
It has also been most gratifying in
bringing this team of incredible Wurzweiler
School of Social Work students together who have just poured
themselves into it with enthusiasm and
knowledge and expertise and resources
and willingness to go the extra
mile and do whatever it takes to make sure that
we create these wonderful experiences for people.
To actually see it happening now and
to see the turnouts we get and have a full room with people
and to see these events come to life has just
been really interesting and inspiring.
