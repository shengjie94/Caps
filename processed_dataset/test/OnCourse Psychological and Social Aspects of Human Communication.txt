Having some insights into how communication works
really helps in making you a more effective communicator,
and I think can really make your life better.
This is the first time the class has been offered.
It's a class where you are exposed to the main theories and the main concepts
about human communication, coming from a number of disciplines,
including psychology, anthropology, linguistics, communication studies.
Professor Galantucci runs the psychology and communication lab here at YU.
Running that program gives him the opportunity
to give over a lot of practical experience in his lectures.
The format of Human Communications is definitely something
that I haven't seen in any of my other classes,
how it keeps you engaged with the material.
After the fourth, fifth week of the class, we start shifting to a different format
in which it is the students that are actually presenting.
It was very interesting to try to teach a class. I've never done that before.
You really understand the material more when you have to give it over.
I introduced the term of politeness.
For example, when we are talking, if you ask me a question,
I'm kind of obliged to answer the question, because if not, it's not polite.
The discussions that spin off from those presentations have contributed greatly
to my overall understanding of what it means to have a successful human interaction.
That's the way you really know that a student has understood a concept,
the moment they can live it.
Human communication happens in the class all the time.
So students might ask me, "So, what is 'repair'?"
And I say, "What did you say?"
And they would ask me, "I said, what is 'repair'?"
I said "Yes, that's exactly what happened."
A repair in conversation is what happens when something breaks down
and so you try to fit it. I didn't understand, and now we're doing a repair.
I think as a result of the conversations we've had in class,
m much more intentional with the way I speak.
That's not something I expected to take out of the course, actually.
This has even promted me to look into maybe adding a sociology minor,
in terms of the sociology of human communication,
and that's something I never would have explored.
Let's say that you are going in a country where you don't speak the language,
and all of a sudden you find yourself having to communicate
without having an established means to do so.
Really delving into the problem of how humans create a communications system from scratch.
Every bias that we built in our communication system, we need to be aware,
so that we can remove in order to be able to communicate with them.
Our class happens to have a lot of international students, and I think that's really fascinating
because we're talking about what is unique in different human cultures, and also what is universal.
And we get a lot of insight from students from around the world
about what goes on in their home countries, and we can see from there,
certain gestures are very specific to cultures, but facial expressions are kind of universal.
We're a small group of students, so that also makes it easier.
The discussion can get a lot more in-depth and personal
because of closeness we've developed over the course of the semester.
My experience in YU, the small class sizes, make it a lot easier
to develop relationships with the various professors, but also with my peers.
I like it very much. It's something different.
We get to know, to speak, to debate, to think out of the box. I think it's really important.
