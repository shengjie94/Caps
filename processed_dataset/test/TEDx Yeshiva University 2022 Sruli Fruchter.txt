a while back
i saw an instagram post describing a
movie
it said a boy escapes from a cupboard
and goes to a castle
then uses a stick to fight a bald pale
guy with no nose
didn't sound so exciting
and then i realized i was talking about
harry potter
this is obviously hilarious and i saw
the same trend hashtag explain a film
plot badly used to describe other famous
books and movies which were equally
hysterical but it brought me to think
about
how the way we describe understand and
relate to things how we perceive them
can so strongly affect how we experience
them
more than just making a good meme this
idea has the potential to significantly
change things in our lives which brings
us to today's talk
my name is philippe fruchter and i'm
graduating from yeshiva university this
coming may
ever since i was a senior in high school
i've been obsessed with meaning
it was the focal point of my gap year in
jerusalem before college and continue to
be so afterward
when i first got to campus i encountered
a difficulty
one of college's main goals is planning
and preparing students for a career
and as a first-time on-campus student
with no major and no direction
i wondered how can i find a career a
profession
where i could make my work meaningful
where it would actually be meaningful
and that was a question my friends were
also struggling with
i recall countless hangouts on the couch
and meals in the cafeteria we would talk
about our futures and to be frank the
answers were not very inspiring i have
this one friend we all have that one
friend and he couldn't even sugarcoat it
listen he would tell us we're gonna get
nine to five jobs sitting behind a desk
maybe in an interesting field involving
something cool probably not
and it's gonna stink but that's fine
because we'll get paid and find meaning
somewhere else in our lives
it wasn't exactly an optimistic forecast
i'd say not at all
but the thing is
and this here's the main thing
my friend really wasn't so far off
in a 2021 survey by pew research center
only 17 percent of americans said that
their career or occupation contributed
meaning to their lives 83 didn't even
mention it
for something that holds or is going to
hold so much of our time
those numbers are really disappointing
today i'd like to suggest that that does
not need to be the case that we can all
find meaning in our work no matter what
we choose to do
so indulge me for a moment who here has
ever watched harry potter by a show of
hands
and who's never read the books or some
of them
a cultured crowd that's always good to
see
now think back to the beginning of this
talk the way i described harry potter to
you
i'm going to venture to guess that for
most if not all of you
that description didn't match what
you've previously thought about harry
potter
and the reason is because the way you
tell a story
affects how you experience the story
harry potter as boy who escapes from
cupboard to fight bald pale guy is not
the exciting story of a young wizard on
a quest to save the wizarding world
so i ask you
what if
the way we think about our work
is like that first perspective of harry
potter what if
in every single job behind every desk
at every register in every courtroom and
hospital
there is a wondrous world of excitement
meaning
drama and purpose waiting to be unlocked
what if our work could be
so much more than how we currently think
about it
the answer to these questions lies in a
concept called narrative identity
narrative identity is a theory that says
we create and form our identities our
sense of self and how we think about
ourselves by looking at the events of
our lives our upbringing setbacks
accomplishments all of it and threading
them into a cohesive narrative to put it
simply we form our identities from the
stories we tell ourselves about
ourselves as humans we love stories we
read crime and mystery novels watch
daring and emotional films and tell the
tales of history who doesn't love a good
story we all know what one looks like
how it can inspire us with hope and
vision
leaving us with something more when it's
over
and we also know what a bad story looks
like how can we how it can leave us
feeling kind of sad and empty
itching for something more
the thing is
we are constantly telling ourselves
stories
about the lives of our friends the lives
of our families and the lives of
ourselves
these stories are how we connect
interpret and make sense of the various
parts of our lives
the goal
is to get back in control to take the
pen and sit as the conscious authors of
those stories
because we are each the main character
the protagonist of our life
and if we want to change how we
experience our lives then we need to
change how we talk about our lives
narrative identity gives us that power
it gives us the power to find new found
meaning in every part of our lives
so
if we want to make our work meaningful
then we need to tell ourselves a better
story about that work
now i have some familiarity with
storytelling and i know how powerful a
good story can be
for the last three years i've been a
journalist for one of you's independent
student newspapers the commentator first
as a staff writer then as a news editor
and now as editor-in-chief
and in that capacity i've written and
edited hundreds of articles
people events news all of it come to my
desk and i along with my staff need to
find what significance each story has
why it's important why it matters what
it means
but the article that we eventually
publish is really the one we initially
get there's a process that needs to be
underdone
that we need to do to discover that
story
take for example an article we published
back in december
why use registration process was flawed
one student decided to fix that
the article was about how when students
register for their courses they need to
use the university system which isn't
perfect say the least the search options
available information and function are
very very limited in response a computer
science student a sophomore named oz
designed and created a website that gave
students way more information with a
user-friendly format for them to
research their courses before choosing
them
on its face it doesn't sound so exciting
seems pretty mundane
but this article was one of our most
widely read of that issue here's why
when we first heard about this article
about the story
the available information was that a
student created a website that gave
others
more
guidance in choosing their classes
definitely piqued our interests
but we weren't sold that we found the
story
ultimately the finished article was
about how through ambition and grit one
student did something that really
mattered for the students of today and
for those of tomorrow oz always loved
computers but he almost dropped his
first intro to computer science course
and he didn't
instead he persevered and he
accomplished something really important
for the student body
of today and a student body of tomorrow
this is a story of personal and communal
triumph
now think about how our perspective on
this can so significantly change by how
we consider it
boy makes website that helps
or ambitious student
addresses flaw in university system
through dedication and creativity one of
these sounds way more interesting than
the other and that's by design
we at the commentator through creativity
and reframing
gave our readers something more than
just a quick read because that's what
journalism is it's a professional
storytelling business we look at the
facts we consider the context and then
we tell the story
and we need to look at our lives through
the eyes of a journalist a storyteller a
narrator when we do that when we create
a story for ourselves and act to write
it we take agency over our lives and we
hold the opportunity to find the meaning
that we crave because meaning
real meaning
is found in the purpose we give to the
parts of our life
and i'm not just saying that anecdotally
in 2015 personality and sociology review
published an article on the incremental
validity of narrative identity and
predicting well-being in english it's a
paper about how narrative identity can
lead us to live a better life
and that's what the researchers found
what they found was that it all came
back to redefining the different parts
of your life
about giving purpose to the things that
seem insignificant what was the
significance of dropping that college
course
how did you feel after completing that
summer internship or that project
what did it mean to you to move to that
location as opposed to somewhere else
what went wrong what went right
why did it matter
what did it mean
the power is in the question just as
much as in the answers so how does this
tie back to work well let me give you an
example
there's an individual i know
who is an aspiring musician but he
hasn't found a success yet
he is truly a man of the arts he loves
culture he loves museums he loves music
he loves paintings
truly a high class individual i think
we'd say
but right now he's working in the fast
food industry trying to make ends meet
as he seeks to build himself as a
musician that can live off of that as
his career
and every day he's challenged personally
and professionally
professionally with colleagues and
customers who aren't always easy
personally
by his own cynicism and his own
pessimism
but that's a journey he's undergoing
there's something unfolding here there's
a story a narrative a narrative arc
that's there and i think as i describe
this it almost sounds like it's
interesting perhaps we'd like to hear
more about this now this person is not
none other than squidward tentacles
and for those of us who are even more
cultured than the harry potter folk and
are familiar with spongebob i don't
think this is how we would normally
think of squidward
the thing is because squidward has not
yet heard this talk
he doesn't know about narrative identity
because with narrative identity
squidward's work does not need to be
meaningless and frustrating and
upsetting
his work can be meaningful
and that is something that's open to us
all we tend to think of work in two
pools there's meaningful work and
non-meaningful work meaningful work is
usually that in the public sector it's
advocacy non-profit work something
devoted to a greater cause that we deem
important
non-meaningful work is everything else i
mean i guess i suppose you can throw in
medical careers in the meaningful work
too great we have a limited amount of
options for those who are going into the
meaningful field you have the potential
to join the 17 of people who find that
their job gives meaning to their life
and for the rest of us it's not
promising
but with narrative identity we can move
past that binary completely because
narrative identity says that you
no matter what your job is
no matter what your field is
you can make your work meaningful
something that adds real important value
to your life
and it all comes down to the mindset you
have
if you want to think like squidward or
like my friend well then that's what
your life will be that's how your work
will be in your story you'll trudge to
work every day nine to five engage in
bunch of meaningless tedious tasks to
collect your paycheck and this will not
earn any chapter in your story
but narrative identity allows us to take
it further and it's about getting
creative about looking beneath the
surface to discover
what is the real story here
personally how are you personally
challenged at work behaviorally
emotionally professionally
there's personal purpose to be found in
your workplace
how are you contributing to the
workplace
quantitatively in terms of the actual
role that you fill there's a reason the
company made that role the organization
made it
and qualitatively in the energy that you
bring to colleagues and customers and
clients
you weren't born the day before hiring
you come to this job with a context a
history a complexity
there's something special that you bring
to the that you bring to that role
and think back to individual things and
plug it in and this is not about lying
to yourself far from it when journalists
try and look for the most whole and
compelling truth we're not lying we're
trying to find the greatest truth out
there
the most compelling truth that our
readers want and that our readers need
so why can't we do this name for
ourselves
by showing bear reshalam noah
barachovsky known as aslano rebbe told
us this idea many years ago
in the torah it says
see i set before you blessing and curse
and i think naturally we all have the
same instinct wear it at because i'll
take the blessing any day of the week
what he tells us is something profound
and it links to this concept perfectly
we each have a purpose something unique
that we are meant to do a book we are in
the process of writing
my purpose is unlike yours yours is
unlike mine and so on you can't do what
i what i can do and i can't do what you
can do there's something specific
a story you're meant to write
but how do you access the blessing of
that story how do you make that story
meaningful
a story you want to be a part of
what comes down to your perspective
let's take an example and we can all
plug in our own individual examples and
i think you'll see how this fits
suppose you're working with a client or
a colleague on a project
if you view that
as if it's meaningless and it offers
nothing of substance to your life then
it's gonna feel like a per a curse
tedious
burdensome
pointless
but if you think about what it offers to
your story what chapter heading will it
be in
how are you growing what are you
bringing to the workplace to society to
yourself to your family
there's a reason it exists and there's a
reason you're there
if that's the mindset you approach then
it's going to be a blessing
narrative identity leads us on the path
to live a life of meaning a life of
blessing
so if you'll indulge me once more
everyone close your eyes or don't i
can't tell you what to do and
pick an internship you've had a job an
experience where it may have felt
meaning meaningless
and think
what did it give to me
what was i challenged to do there what
was i challenged personally
with my friends with myself
if i'm writing my book
and this is something the publisher says
must be included
where would i put it in
this is how we find a life of meaning
this is how we make our work meaningful
there's a story waiting to be written
it's already in progress
the life
of meaning
the blessed life is available to us all
and i hope we all the strength and the
courage to pursue it
thank you
you
