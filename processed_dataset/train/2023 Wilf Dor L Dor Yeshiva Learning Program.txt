UC University put together a wonderful
program this morning is the Darla door
learning program where I have a chance
to learn together with my son experience
what he goes through for his judaic
Studies classes every morning
and I'm thrilled to be here
I'd like to learn what they're learning
how they're learning
how these young gentlemen are becoming
leaders of our future generation so I'd
say just you know showing him the
regular day that I do here and the
learning that I do with my raveum and
the other tal medium and my friends and
my tabusas and everyone I'm just kidding
to bring my dad in on that and show him
the everyday process of the learning
that goes on here well it's great it's
by third or fourth grandson I'm losing
Council but haven't been at Yu are still
at Yu So I myself graduated in 1964 and
so we're really a Hawaiian family
definitely most excited to show the
sheer or vain the guys things that I've
talked about over the course of the year
that they haven't actually get to
experience it's important for alumni
like myself and my wife to be able to
come back spend some time with our son
who's here living in our footsteps
most excited to just have the
opportunity for the three of us to learn
Torah together and to see David and
shear and to really experience Yeshiva
University and all that it has to offer
when we made a decision that we wanted
our children to have a bona fide Jewish
Education
and we said let's try to get them into
Yeshiva University well you spend a lot
of your time effort and tears and money
sending your kids to an institution like
this and you want to see it in practice
and to be able to see it firsthand with
the rabam and with him was
excellent opportunity
