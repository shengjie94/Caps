Hi! My name is Dr. Dan Kimmel and I'm a professor of Sociology here at Yeshiva University.
Learning to work with your professors is an integral part of succeeding in college.
This video will help you understand what your professors expect of you.
Professors are experts in their field and they're eager for you to succeed.
They usually encourage participation and are open to questions during class and/or during office hours.
Some courses require attendance, others do not.
Check your syllabus to determine relevant course work requirements.
Either way, attendance is important as you will benefit from hearing the lecture,
the questions of your fellow students, reviews of the homework,
and information about upcoming assignments and exams.
You are expected to complete all of your assignments on time.
If you're having difficulty completing an assignment on time, speak to you professor in advance.
They may be able to help you with your work or arrange another solution.
You are encouraged to participate in class.
In fact, in some courses class participation is factored into your overall grade.
Your participation should reflect your completing the assigned reading or homework,
so be sure to come prepared for every class.
College is a time to consider different viewpoints and explore new horizons.
During class discussions and when working on assignments,
try to remain open to new ideas.
Keeping this mind can also help you better understand your course material.
If you're unsure or confused about any information, ask you professor for clarification,
ideally during class.
Chances are other students will have similar questions
and will also benefit from hearing the professor's explanation.
Studies show that one of the best predictors of success in college
is establishing meaningful relationships with professors and mentors.
With these tips in mind, you will be better prepared
to develop a good working relationship with your professors in Yeshiva University.
