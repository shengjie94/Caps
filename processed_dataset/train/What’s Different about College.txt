Hi! My name is Shlomo and I am a senior at Yeshiva University.
In this session, we're going to see what's different about college.
Whether or not you worked hard in high school, your academic experience in college will be different.
That means that each semester progresses at a rapid pace
and you need to interpedently stay on top of your readings so as not to fall behind.
Some classes are small and tend to be more interactive.
Others are large lecture courses and may have more than 50 students.
Nobody will chase you down if you have not turned in your homework assignments or papers.
It is up to you to make sure that your assignments are completed on time.
You'll need to put in study time after class for each of your courses.
A good rule of thumb is two hours of study time for every hour of class time.
In high school, your success on exams often depended on your ability to memorize information.
In college, you'll be asked to learn on a deeper level
and be expected to apply information to apply information to new situations
analyze content, and evaluate and justify your opinions and arguments.
For example, after reading an article,
you may be asked to formulate an argument based on the author's opinion:
what does the author believe about liberal arts, modern sciences, etc.
These have been some of the ways that college is different than high school.
With these tips, you're ready to embark on your college experience.
