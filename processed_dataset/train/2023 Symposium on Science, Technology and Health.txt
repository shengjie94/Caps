you know, the
Katz Symposium is a signature event
This year we have over 20 projects across our STEM
and health science programs.
Where our students showcase some of the amazing work
they have been doing
to advance scholarly knowledge and to work on
solutions for industry challenges.
So this event will show you
not only the caliber of our students,
but also the nature of work
that they are doing.
It's so impactful, it's so meaningful,
and they are making
a difference in the world.
I was really grateful
and honored for being chosen as one of the
people that present their work. I would say
it was a really great experience,
it was a culmination of lot of hard work and effort
throughout the year, which I'm really proud of.
Our students amaze me.
extend a very special
thanks to all of our students who came
and in particular their families.
And I also want to thank
our industry partners
for coming. Their enthusiasm, their support.
It just means so much to us.
