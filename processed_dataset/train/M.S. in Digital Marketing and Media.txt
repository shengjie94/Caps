as an influencer I am the brand
I am building myself out there in New York City
constantly
going and fitting to brands that I wanna work with
lingoers I was here in New York City starting colleges
I was in a different university before
the program was that I wasn't that hands on
I wanted to floor a distant side of marketing
so I think joining the task program give me that um
set of skills that are required
to sell myself as a brand
everything that I'm learning from this
program is gonna help me in my influence
about it because I wanna work with lot of big brands
here in New York City
go for this program because so you gonna get really
really amazing factory professors
they are working in this investment
you would learn a lot
and you would gain so much confidence in yourself
so now that I'm here in the city
my dreams are bigger than ever
and I still aspire to make a significant impact
in this fashion industry and I would like to thank
gatsku for making this dream possible
it opened a lot of doors for me
and I look forward for more
adventures that lie ahead of me
