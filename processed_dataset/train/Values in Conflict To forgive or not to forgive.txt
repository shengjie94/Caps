it's such an important moment
for our students to gather
on September 11th
and to think about
both the
the moral ethical legal ramifications
but certainly the human
elements of September 11th tonight's
program is a part of our values and
conflict series and we have about four
of those programs throughout the year
and we're really looking forward to
seeing you and and you joining all these
types of leadership opportunities and
conversations that we have it's an honor
on this somber day to have you with us
in 2014 Rabbi Jonathan Sachs
wrote after 9 11 when the horror and
Trauma had subsided Americans found
themselves asking what had happened and
why was it a disaster a tragedy a crime
an act of War it didn't fit into any
pre-existing paradigms and why had it
happened and he tried to answer some of
those questions in his book not in God's
name confronting religious violence Ken
can you can you take us I mean one of
the things you do so effectively in the
book you tell the human story
are there people who stick in your mind
to this day whose faces you remember you
say oh that that was a painful moment or
that was a story I'll never forget oh my
goodness
every day I think about those people
that I met
it was debilitating it's still
debilitating after 9 11 that's a tough
question what type of Duties we would
have but you know three of them that
come to mind are a duty to respond to
the evil
to honor the victims and their families
and to honor the heroes of the First
Responders to recognize what they did to
put their lives at risk to help others I
remember shortly after 9 11 there was a
firefighter who lived two blocks away
from us right between my house and my
grandfather's house
and we all went to pay a shivikov he
wasn't Jewish but there was a real
there's an outpouring from the Jewish
Community to come and support and show
our recognition for what they did memory
revitalization
it's wonderful I think it's wonderful
the problem is that memory of 9 11
somehow doesn't include
remembering how the country responded
with a communitarian ethic
we are one nation
we work together in times of tragedy
we will honor the memory of the dead as
as well we should
the rabbi points out
and we should honor the memory of the
First Responders
but step back and also learn a little
bit from memory
of how our nation responded as one
very deep hope I look around this room
and I see people who weren't in 9 11 but
they're here tonight because they feel
that memory is important I hope they'll
all help us with our Morocco funds that
we can help people across the world and
feel that we're in an international
Collective Consciousness
today my I spoke to my five-year-old
grandson he said softy today is Heroes
day
and I thought ah the next generation
will also know so I want to thank you
for your service to this community thank
you for your service to this country may
all those who died May their memories
always be for a blessing may we forgive
may we not forget and
um and may we take this moment to do
something good for the world thank you
[Applause]
