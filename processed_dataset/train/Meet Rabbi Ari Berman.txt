Hi, I am Ari Berman
and I am excited about returning to my alma mater, to Yeshiva University
And I am deeply humbled to follow in a long line of extraordinary Jewish leaders
and to serve as the fifth president of Yeshiva University.
For over 100 years, Yeshiva University has trained generations of leaders
in countless fields and disciplines
who have impacted both the Jewish community and broader society.
We are living an era that is both daunting and wondrous.
Jewish history, in Israel and throughout the world, is unfolding before our very eyes.
Technology is developing at breakneck speeds
as new human capital across the globe is being tapped.
The world of higher education is shifting in unprecedented ways.
I am excited about Yeshiva University's future.
I am excited to craft a mission and vision for the Yeshiva University of tomorrow
that will meet the challenges and the opportunities of a rapidly changing world.
And I'm excited to partner with all those who deeply care
about the future of the Jewish world and the flourishing of our global society.
I look forward to continuing our conversation.
