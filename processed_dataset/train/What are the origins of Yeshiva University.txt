moving
to our next institution
um the origins of um the rabbi isaac
al-khan and theological seminary reads
that's also
late eighteen hundreds
so yeshiva eightshayan was an elementary
school founded in 1886.
yeshiva university today
has on its
logo 1886 as a year of origin
because uh
eventually merged with rabbi's
theological seminary which was
established as a higher place of
learning yeshiva yeshiva godola advanced
yeshiva in 1897. it was named after by
isaac also inspector the chief rabbi of
kavanaugh who died in 1896 and why was
it named after him because he was one of
the few rabbis the doleem of the old
world
who was uh okay with people moving to
america
in the eyes of other great rabbis it was
the traifor medina the non-kosher land
where the stones are impure whereas
rabbi specter he said it's okay to go
and it's okay for rabbis to go and in
fact rabbis should go to be leaders of
the flock so the yeshiva was named after
him
it was basically just a yeshiva for
people to learn at
the first decade of its existence
and
not to ordain rabbis
people off the boat who had been yeshiva
students in europe
wanted a place that was comfortable for
them they were comfortable studying in a
yeshiva environment so this was a
landing spot for a lot of you know great
uh alerted men
but in between 1906 and 1908
there was some student revolts student
strikes
because they wanted more secular
education
they wanted to be able to compete with
the graduates of shefter seminary as
rabbis for american judaism which you
could not do unless you spoke a pristine
english and had some kind of a secular
knowledge
and that eventually led to the hiring of
bernard revel in 1915 revel would
establish the high school which is today
mta
uh and eventually the college yeshiva
college in 1928.
