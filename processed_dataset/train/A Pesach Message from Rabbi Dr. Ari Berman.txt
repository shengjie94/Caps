Pesach is the holiday of memory.
We tell the story of our history,
and celebrate with the ritual foods and family recipes
that have been passed down to us from generation to generation.
We sit at the seder with our loved ones,
remembering those we cherish who are no longer around our table.
But it is also the holiday of hope and anticipation.
ve-higadeta le-vinkha ba-yom ha-hu––we answer our children's questions today
so that they, in turn, can answer their children's questions tomorrow.
It is about pushing history forward, le-shanah ha-ba'ah bi-yerushalayim ha-benuyah.
As the educational and spiritual epicenter of our global community,
we at Yeshiva University are proud of the central role we play
in educating the coming generations of Jewish students and future leaders.
It is here that we teach our students and broadcast to the world how to live lives
that are both deeply rooted and forward focused, filled with meaning, impact and success.
This Pesach we share with you some of the ideas that animate our teaching
and anchor our community.
May this holiday of redemption be filled with joy and celebration,
as past and present unite to ensure a brighter future.
Chag kasher vesameach.
