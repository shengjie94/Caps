The libraries offer so much for so many students.
We have group study rooms, computers,
printers and scanners.
We have books. But we have not just books,
we have electronic books,
databases with journals
and magazines and newspapers.
The course materials are put on reserve
and they can just access it fairly easily.
If there's anything that we don't have,
we have an interlibrary loan service.
The best way for the students
to interact with our office
is to stop by and visit us in person.
But second best is to go to the library website
which is library.yu.edu.
I think it's important that
the students learn
that they shouldn't only use Google
and Wikipedia
for when they are doing their assignments.
It isn't really the same type of information
that you would use for a college course.
And we are there to teach you
how to extract that from the library
so that you can write a better paper
or put together a better argument.
