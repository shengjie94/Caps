Hi! My name is Yardena Katz and I'm a junior at Yeshiva University.
Today, we're going to be looking at the question:
How should I manage my time?
Do you often feel that you do not have enough time in the day to accomplish all you need to achieve?
You can learn to use your time more efficiently by improving your time management skills.
In high school, your day was structured for you and your class schedule was assigned to you.
In college, you decide how to spend your time and which courses to select.
Begin by creating a weekly schedule.
You can use your phone or a planner to keep track of assignments and exams.
Plan to spend about 2 hours of study time for every hour spent in class on a regular basis.
Create SMART goals. For example - instead of saying I will improve my grades in Biology,
set the following goal: I will improve my grade on my next biology test by reading the text for the next
thirty minutes, taking notes, and taking practice tests over the next week.
It is also important to prioritize your work.
Study more difficult subjects first and when you are most alert.
You may be eager to sign up for clubs, teams, and other extracurricular activities.
College is a time to discover and broaden your horizons,
but start slowly since you can always add more to your schedule.
The key to your success is finding the balance between
your academic, social, and personal interests and your responsibilities.
